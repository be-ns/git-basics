### Working with files is why Git exists - it makes it easier than saving because you can revert to previous files when you need to!

### We'll get there soon enough - but first let's work on __getting__ files you want. 

1. Let's say you want a fresh copy of a document you found - for example - [this](url.com)
 `git clone username@host:/path/to/repository` - creates a nifty copy from an online source - a la Github or Bitbucketgit  
2. If it's a local file (on your own computer), you'll use `clone /path/to/repository`
