### GETTING STARTED  
 1. [Download git for MacOS](http://git-scm.com/download/mac)  
 2. [Download git for Windows](http://msysgit.github.io/)
 3. [Download git for Linux](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)  
 
* Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers  
* Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project. These are typed into the command line (Terminal or iTerm on Mac)  
 * `git init` creates a new Git repository - think __initialize__  
 * `git status` inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area - think __what's the status of git?__  
 * `git add` adds files from the working directory to the staging area. Like putting the file in a box before shipping it out.  
 * `git diff` shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area - __difference__  
 * `git commit` permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository - commit is the same as __submitting__ your code or file  
 * `git log` shows all previous commits - think of it like a captain's log  
 

### RESETS and MULTIPLE COMMITS
 1. In Git, the commit you are on is knows as the `HEAD` commit.  
 * To see the `head`, you'll type `git show HEAD` in the terminal.  
 The output of this command will display everything the git log command displays for the `HEAD` commit, plus all the file changes that were committed.  
 * Why is that useful? Let's say you made a silly mistake and can't recall how to fix it. You can use `HEAD` to revert your file to the committed version:  
 `git checkout HEAD filename` will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit.  
 * __Alternatively__ if you wanted to use a specific file instead of the last used commit (for example `changes.txt`) you would enter:  
 `git checkout HEAD changes.txt`  
 2. How would you add multiple files at once, you may be asking... Well, Git comes with a solution to that as well!  
 * `git ass file_name_1 file_name_2  
 3. But what if you change a line from one of these two files?:  
 * You can reset a file in the staging area by using the command `git reset HEAD file_name_1  
 This resets the file in the 'box' and removes it from the staging area.  
 *
