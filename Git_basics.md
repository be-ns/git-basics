* Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers  
* Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:  
 * `git init` creates a new Git repository - think __initialize__  
 * `git status` inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area - think __what's the status of git?__  
 * `git add` adds files from the working directory to the staging area  
 * `git diff` shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area - __difference__  
 * `git commit` permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository - commit is the same as __submitting__ your code or file
 * `git log` shows all previous commits - think of it like a captain's log
